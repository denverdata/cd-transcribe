 some questions and stuff that we haven't talked about. Thank you, Mariah. And then to, you know, from that to talk about what is it that, you know, do we need all of that to launch this thing or can we get away with a subset and then perhaps implement some of these things subsequently, really with the goal of getting you some bang for the buck before we go down and develop the system, you know, over the longer term. And so the questions really had to do with that. The first thing on my list was to talk about terms. And we've got a number of terms that we're using. And I apologize, Dr. Cole, we do have only about 30 minutes before we have to go to another meeting, but we can make some headway anyway. Making sure that we understand terms and have a good shared understanding of what those are. Clinician and clinician sounds like it is all in clinician the way it's currently used. Define clinician for me. I know you've done this, but it'll be easier to start that way than for me to try and tell you. Any person that performs an evaluation. Thanks, John. Does that include people that might supervise the evaluation as well? Yep. So that includes interns, trainees, supervisors. Supervisor, that is the direct person that the clinician reports to, correct? That is the person the trainee will report to. So a clinician can technically be the supervisor. So yeah, trainee supervisor. Okay, so only trainees have a supervisor that's relevant to the system. Correct. And a trainee is a... How many different types of trainees do you have? Two. They'll either be an intern or a postdoc. Postdoc? Yeah, postdoctoral. Does that mean they're doing like residency or something along those lines or what does that mean? Yep, it's their one-year residency. Thank you. That helps me. I don't know the business inside now by any means. So that's really helpful to me. And then an intern is somebody... Does that mean that intern... What's the distinction with an intern? They're not paying a doctoral check? Yep. So it's their very last year of their doctoral program. It's the last step they need to get their doctorate. That's it. So that's before you go to postdoc. Yep. Got it. Thank you very much. That's helpful. That will help me in other areas of my life. Now that all works. Last year. Justin, were there any other terms that we had floating around that was really the big list? That gives me enough of an understanding that I can use the correct term when we're discussing these things. And we'll just build in a quick glossary at the front of our document. Anything else that comes to mind, Justin, that you feel like we didn't have a good definition of? Shadower? I think we were... Oh yeah, that's right. Shadow. That's right. Shadow, basically. And there's a couple of... So let's... Shadow, what does that mean? And I kind of know what it means. So when a trainee is just starting out evaluations, they require the presence of another clinician to basically teach them the evaluations. So that other clinician can be their supervisor or it just may be another clinician who's experienced. So that's the process of shadowing. And then the person who does the shadowing gets paid a fee for that. Okay. And the fee is based on what type of shadowing they need to do. What are the different degrees of shadowing, the full versus reviewing their work? Or shadowing different from reviewing their work? Right. Yeah. Shadowing and review of work is different. So shadowing is going to be in person. And there's usually just two types of shadowing. Either it's full shadowing, which is shadowing the whole evaluation, or partial shadowing, which is just shadowing one or two tests. And how do you know what they have to do? How do you know what to assign to the person that is shadowing? So based off of... So if the trainee has just started with us, inevitably it'll be full shadowing. The only time we go down to partial shadowing is for our autism specific evaluations. Once a trainee is done with the full shadowing, the supervisors for this evaluation only, only autisms, still has to sit in with them for two tests for the whole year, because the tests are so complicated. So it'll only really apply to this autism spectrum evaluation after the full shadowing period is over, then they drop to partial shadowing for it. And what's the period of time that they have to do the full shadowing? Usually it's just two weeks. The other one that came to mind, and I think I can think of it now. So the other one was talking about an evaluation. And the way we've been looking at this so far is that it's an evaluation that when you receive a referral, that's a referral for an evaluation. And an evaluation is then the thing that gets assigned to a primary clinician, potentially gets assigned to a shadow clinician that gets the scheduled date for the initial evaluation. And the question was, are there other things logically that need to be included into what Kehilia thinks of as an evaluation? For example, the meeting, the pre-screening or whatever it is, the phone call that has to happen in advance of the evaluation. That it seems like in some cases, a single evaluation consists of a couple different appointments. So at first contact, somebody schedules, and that's when we get the pre-screening information. We'll sometimes have to follow up, we'll sometimes email it to them and they'll follow up and return it to us. But in terms of just the evaluation part, generally speaking, we knock it all out in one day. So it's just a one day thing. But if we can't finish due to time constraints or a behaviorally temperamental child, we may then schedule the remaining tests for a different day. Okay. And that would still be part of that same evaluation. It's still one check that you get paid at the end. Exactly. And it's still the same one flat rate to the clinician. Yep. Gotcha. Okay. All right. That helps me. And what cases does that pre-screen have to happen? And what are the worst case scenarios? Are there times when that pre-screening happens in advance? The pre-screening, does that always happen? I guess that's my first question. In terms of pre-screening, it's basically any client who wants to have an evaluation with us, they have to submit forms. And then we review the forms. One of our clinicians will review the forms to decide if they're appropriate for our clinic or not. And that's just an administrative task. So that's kind of the intake paperwork, insurance plan and all that stuff as well. Yeah. They'll send us two forms, one of demographics and insurance, the others a history form so we can see what their symptoms are. As long as their insurance is covered, then good. And then if their history looks fine and we can assess for it, then we'll then approve it for scheduling. And then there's some instances where we can't perform the evaluation due to different reasons, which will then flag it until the admin to refer elsewhere. Right. Right. Do you think, I guess what I'm thinking is, is what it makes, so we get a new referral in and they do require, they've never been there before, so you have to go collect that information from them. Does it make sense, do you think, to pre-screen and then schedule their assessment or is it, or would it be more typical for her to schedule that assessment, then get on the phone and pre-screen and then find out that maybe it needs to be canceled? So we always pre-screen and then schedule because for us, we have a pretty high no-show rate with some of our insurance people. So we find that we reduce the no-show rate if we absolutely require the pre-screening to happen before scheduling. Okay. So it may make sense that this doesn't become bundled too tightly with the analysis itself. It's a prerequisite of having, it's a prerequisite of getting an evaluation, but it is not part of the evaluation. Correct. And the screening function, we have a task flow in our EHR where we create the clients, then make a note that we've sent paperwork. When the paperwork's there, we send a task to the clinician. They review it, then give it the green light. So all that's automated pretty well in the EHR. Okay. Okay. So we could probably more or less presume that that piece has been done if Cahelia is even using, if she's even scheduling an evaluation. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. If she's scheduling an evaluation, that part has been done. Does it make sense to have a checkbox or something to signify that so that somebody can't accidentally just proceed without having done that pre-screen? Or do you think that's always pretty applied and more safe to just assume it's not going to happen until they're not going to start here until they've done it? It wouldn't hurt, especially since we're tossing around the idea of including some scheduling functionality to the software. It would probably would make sense since again, we're going to be using two systems, our EHR and then this, it would be nice, I guess, to have a checkbox to say, yep, we looked in the EHR, all that's done. This is, we proceed with scheduling. It's been confirmed and they do have a record in EHR. Yeah. Okay. Got it. That's some nice stuff. What does EHR stand for? Sorry. It's an electronic health record. Electronic health record. That's the third party software package that used to manage all the... Is that the same place that the feedback is recorded? Yeah. And the same place where we get their UUID. Is that an online system, browser-based system? Yep. Yeah. If you ever want to look at it, it's practicefusion.com. Cool. Thank you very much. So we want to add a check mark that verifies that a user has pre-screen and that the pre-screen has been completed and a record is added to the... I think that the confirmation is that they've been confirmed to be in the EHR system. Okay. That they've had an intake at some point, that they're confirmed to be up to date in the EHR system. Which means they've either been pre-screened or they were already in there and don't need to be pre-screened. Is that correct? Yeah. I think the box that says they've been... Yeah. They're in the EHR and they've been pre-screened. Okay. Not all people that are in our EHR will have been pre-screened. Some are in process. I get you. Okay. Thank you very much. So we want to confirm that they are in the EHR and that they're... That that's been completed. Okay. Okay. That was the big ones. And actually that knocked out a lot of what was on our list. I had a quick question. So Dr. Cole mentioned that building into scheduling, what other type of scheduling are you envisioning? Would that be the appointments stuff or... I guess you can enlighten me on that a little bit. Yeah. I could actually share my screen with you. Let me pull up my calendar real quick. I can just kind of show you what we include on our calendar. There's a few different things we'll include, but let me open the week view and choose the correct calendar. Okay. I've got like 12 calendars. Yeah. We have a bunch here. Yeah. I'm still stumped about who popped in that meeting. Yeah. It was funny. He thought I was a different client. So I think he must've meant to send the invite to the client, but somehow it got sent to me. I'm guessing. It's got to be David. It's got to be. Yeah. It almost has to be. Yeah. It's almost got to be David. I've just never had that happen ever. No, that's a new one. I mean, we have had, because we are just moving, transitioning from one meeting infrastructure to another, we did have a couple of weeks ago, one where we had two meetings using the same code. Okay. We've got most of that stuff hammered out. For whatever reason, what I have on my phone, I can't get to show up on my computer, but I'll just describe. Okay. It's supposed to mirror on my Mac, but it's not working. So generally on our schedule right now, we're using Google calendar to schedule it. So we'll have a different calendar, one for the Colorado Springs location, one for the Denver location. And let's just say I'm looking at Thursday. It'll show you which evaluations are scheduled that day, what type with what evaluator also on our schedule. We'll show if somebody has a supervision meeting with their supervisor. We'll have, you know, if we have a training meeting with our training staff, a supervision meeting with our supervision staff. So all of our internal meetings as well. So pretty much anything that we would do in the business in terms of meetings, trainings, supervision, clinic coverage, who's all that stuff we put on the calendar too. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Okay. That's a good answer. And I, Justin, I was just, I was just thinking about what I think I'm thinking you were getting up by asking that. Yeah. I was just making sure there wasn't anything included that he was thinking that should be included in the evaluation part of scheduling. I think that could be a kind of a one off thing where we build a content type that is just really a calendar event that they can really pop onto a calendar that's also shown with the evaluations, but we can talk about that internally. Yeah. And that's probably like a phase two, you know, potential opportunity because we'll have the infrastructure there and we'll already be in a position, you know, where we already got the calendar and we already have all of your, your patients, all the clinicians in the system. Then things like a training would be easy to do through this system because you can just simply say schedule a training, assemble people together from your list and do it. What happens with the training if you're training internally, are they getting paid for that? Yeah. If they're, so they get paid for their shadowing training. Yeah. So they do get paid during that one to two weeks where they're shadowing with somebody else and they're being trained. So they do get paid for that and they get paid their normal rate. What about like internal meetings and stuff like that? Are they? Nope. Okay. None of these other things that you might schedule with staff is a. Yeah. Well, I guess there's one meeting we have a week, the super we have a supervision slash admin meeting every week. And I technically do pay our team to show up to that meeting. Is that mostly like admin staff or is that clinicians? It's two admin staffs and then most of our supervising staff. Okay. When they get paid an hour, are they right for those? Usually the supervisors get paid a hundred bucks and actually the admins, I don't think get paid anything there. They just get their normal hourly fee. So it's just the supervising psychologists who get paid a hundred dollars to show up. A change on occasion. Or is this a control over? Okay. It's always a hundred bucks. Yeah. Okay. And my thought is not necessarily to include this, but it's good that we've talked about it because it starts to unveil other opportunities to use these same systems to, you know, for some efficiency. Yeah. It helps us kind of figure out how we're going to architect it so that we can later on build those things in too. So. Right. It serves as a good platform for the future. Okay. Good. That's really helpful. Practice Fusion was the name of the system. Trying to think of one of the questions I had. Okay. I wanted to talk through the workflow associated with, oh, Justin, we wanted to talk about cancelations and no shows. Yes. That was one of the things. And do you want to bring that up or I can just go into my notes? Yeah, I can definitely share my screen. Cool. And the question had to do with what really is the workflow there? Cancelations for presumably is something that happens directly through Cahelia, I would assume. And in that case, it doesn't necessarily, you know, probably is not. How do cancelations happen? That's the better question. Yeah. So if somebody cancels, usually they call, email or text and let us know that they can't attend and either A, they don't want to attend or B, they need to reschedule. Is there a price implication with either of those answers? No, we're not allowed to charge a fee for cancellations. Okay. Got it. So an evaluation, if somebody was, so we had an evaluation of the system and it's going through the workflow and say it's in the middle and they can't, you know, it's going through the workflow and say it's in the middle and they cancel, would you expect a new evaluation to be created or would we just use the same evaluation? You could use the same and just put it on a different day. Okay. Right. It would just, it would, it would perhaps go back. That's right. The eval would go back to the admin, the admin would reschedule and then it would go back maybe to a different clinician conceivably. Right. It could go to a different clinician. That's right. Yeah. I think that's right. Cool. Okay. So a cancellation, is that ever received by anybody other than the admin? Do they ever cancel to the clinician? It would be incredibly rare. That's pretty much always to the, to the admin. So it sounds like generally speaking, it would not, so if the admin gets it and I think this would be the case that admin is kind of like has all authority meaning that if it's sitting in somebody's queue waiting to be dealt with later today and someone calls and cancels, admin would basically just reclaim that thing from their plate, reschedule it and assign to somebody else. But first and foremost, they would reclaim it as theirs. Yeah. Yep. Yep. I think so. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. What about, what about, sorry, I was going to ask about Notion. Are they any different than cancels or? Yeah, they're a little different. So if cancellations, we'd immediately proceed to rescheduling with a no show. It just triggers us to do one of two things. If it's their first no show, it just, it then go, it would go back to the admin where they have to contact the client and reschedule or B if they've had two consecutive no shows, then it's a notification to the admin to not reschedule and let the client know they have to go to a different clinic. Okay. I'm getting ousted. Yep. All right. That's good. That's good stuff. Okay. No shows. And yeah, that's really, really helpful. Other things that we had were talking about the shadower and defining the person that shadows. And I just really went on the simplest way we can do this, but also just wrap my head around it completely. You know, if the admin is Cahelia sitting there, she's just received an intake. She just received a referral. She is going to key that person in. She's confirmed that they are in the EHR system and everything's good. And she's ready to schedule that. However, this person is a trainee of some kind. How does she know they're a trainee and how does she know what actions to take and what does that mean? So she'll know they're a trainee because they'll already be defined that way. So she'll have a list. She knows who's an intern and a postdoc and who's new. It's really who's new because we have postdocs who've been with us for a year and they don't need shadowing. So it's somebody who's new. They're within their first two to three weeks of training. Yeah, so they're new or they go to a new rotation. And then the shadower, that's where it gets fun, is that it technically can be a lot of different people. Theoretically, it would be great if we could get it to be their supervisor. And sometimes it is, but if their supervisor is busy, it's really anybody at our clinic who has at least a year experience can do that shadowing. So it may make sense that we would default to their manager if they had a drop down there, but Cahelia needs to be able to select anyway. Yeah. Okay. And do they, does either the primary clinician, what would you call the primary clinician on this? You know, is there a word for the person that's doing the analysis versus the person that is shadowing them? So yeah, I guess the primary clinician would be the person actually doing the eval. The shadower is just there for quality control pretty much. They're not necessarily primary because they're not going to actually be involved in the write-up of the report necessarily. So the shadower is there for quality control. So the primary clinician is the one who's in charge of doing the eval. The shadower just makes sure that it's done well. And then the supervisor is after the fact will then be the supervising psychologist who reviews the work with them. And does that happen regardless of whether there's a shadower on the project? Yes. Regardless of whether there's a shadower for any trainee, intern or postdoc, they will always have a supervisor, supervising psychologist review their work. If there are anything, but the, okay, so primary clinician can be a trainee and that, but that person needs to be shadowed. And then they would also have to have a supervisor confirm their work. Yeah. And what do we call a, I'm trying to think of a phrase when I'm thinking. How do we define, so the cases where the supervisor has to review the work, that is for what type of clinician? Trainees and interns? Yeah. Interns and postdocs. Interns and postdocs. Okay. So I guess I'm confused. I heard that supervisor always reviews evaluation feedback or the- Or if you're a trainee of some kind. If you're a trainee, okay. That's right. So in those cases, they will have a shadower. They will always have a shadower. Is that correct? Not always. The shadowing is usually just for the first week or two of their time at our company. Okay. So they can be at intern or postdoc. They can be an intern or pre- They can be an intern or a trainee. They just, I'm sorry, I'm struggling without to say this. That they may not have a shadow or they still would have somebody review their work. Right. Yeah. The shadower is just there for the first two weeks to make sure they're competent in administration. And then after that, there's no shadowing and it's just the primary clinician, the trainee and the supervising psychologist. So shadower is temporary, two weeks max, or versus the supervising psychologist will be, will review the work for any trainee, AKA intern or postdoc for the entire time they're with us. And does it make sense that he would spell that out in the invite and the notice for everybody that's going to have to attend, spelling out to the clinician and the person shadowing. And I guess it wouldn't make sense necessarily to have the person, the reviewing clinician listed on there because that's not a scheduled thing. Right. Right. Exactly. So the supervising psychologist wouldn't necessarily need to be on the psychologist wouldn't necessarily need to be on the schedule because they won't be there. And they'll review the work after the fact. So only the people who are physically present for the evaluation need to be on the calendar. So the clinician and a shadower, if applicable. So it sounds to me that it would be logical that if somebody were, you know, that if that, that there would be a workflow step somewhere before the person has been, before the client has been built and the person has been paid before anybody's been paid, you know, before this, before this assessment has been finalized, where it goes into a state that it's ready for review by the, by the supervisor. Yep. Is it always their supervisor? Yep. They, there's always, and they can either have one supervisor, some of them have two, but there will always be a supervisor within a week. So they have a week after the evaluation is done. They have a week to finish the report and that's the time where they and their supervisor finalize everything. And then once it's finalized and feedback has been given, that's when everyone can get paid. Is there also this Cahelia review at another state? After the supervisor gives it to review, does Cahelia go in and review it? So after the supervisor finalizes, Cahelia does go into review to make sure that feedback was given, that it was recorded in the EHR appropriately, and she'll even go in to check the evaluation to make sure the basic demographics are correct. So she's usually flagged on those just for quality assurance. All right. I think that's a lot of good stuff. Justin, what else did we not touch on? I feel like we covered. We covered a lot here. I mean, that opened a lot of, or answered a lot of our questions. It did. And I think it, I think it did actually. It added a lot of, it lent a lot of clarity to stuff that I was concerned about. And I'm not hearing anything that's outrageously concerning at the moment. The only thing that I'm still a little is how we're going to do the one-offs, but we can talk about that internally. Yeah. And that's, and we'll probably have to come up with a couple. I'm thinking what we'll do with that, Dr. Cole, is that when we revisit to review this, which will be sometime next week, there'll be a couple, we'll walk through some scenarios for some of these and make sure that we're addressing the problem appropriately. Okay. And I think that one's what we'll just have to think about and present some ideas to you rather than kick it around in this session. The other question I had, because we did identify a couple workflow steps. Justin, were there other workflow steps that we had inquired about yesterday? Canceled those though and needs them. I think we covered all of those. I think we just need to update this to kind of include what we've talked about now. Oh, paid when a contractor gets paid. That's right. Does it make sense? We were thinking that the workflow process may make sense to include steps for indicating that either that for a particular evaluation that the contractor has been paid and or that you have been that you have built the insurance company. Are those things that are relevant enough to this to lead them up? And the reason I say is because it would allow, it would give Kahelia a way to look and see which cases still have remaining things to be done, like bill the customer or pay the person. The billing one is definitely important to make sure that an evaluation has been done and something on Kahelia's end to check off that she's billed it because technically she could forget if somebody alerts her that the evaluation is done. So it's good for her to have a task for her to check off that she's actually billed it. In terms of paying the person, that could be a little tricky because we'd have to wait till the end of payroll. It's not really a condition of this thing being done. Yeah. Okay, thank you. That helps me. That helps me. Oh, that's good. Then we need one or one not the other. My last question I have is we talked about deadlines for supervisor review. What other steps in this process have a deadline? Is there a deadline for how quickly someone, how quickly Kahelia needs to get back with someone or how quickly a physician needs to, I guess how quickly they needs to get scheduled? I guess that's the big one or how quickly the follow-up session is if there is one. So other than the week turnaround time for the evaluation to be complete, they have two days to administer feedback and that's really the only hard deadline that we have. We don't have a scheduling deadline because that can vary for a lot of reasons and sometimes we don't have a deadline for when the second part of an evaluation has to be completed because it depends when we can get the client back. So those are the two main things. Okay, so if somebody, so if something goes into, so say a clinician has completed their evaluation and now it's waiting for that feedback, it would be appropriate for that to go into a way to, you know, meet feedback state that would sit in their queue still. They would see it there until they've done the feedback. It might even notify them this is over too and once they've completed that, then it goes back to Cahilia. Yeah, yeah. I think that's all my questions. I think that's all I have for now. I'm sure there'll be stuff that comes out of this but yeah, I think we got a very good picture of what we need to at least update. What do you think about meeting one week? We can either be, I can meet anytime next week but I was thinking to keep it simple. Perhaps we repeat this time slot if that works for you on either Tuesday or Thursday. Yeah, Thursday one o'clock works for me and Cahilia should be back in the office then too. Okay, Mariah, can you get an invite out for that please? And then Tom, you and I I'll set a meeting for us to maybe discuss this probably first Monday or Tuesday or something like that just so we have fresh. And we actually have some time tomorrow that you know wouldn't be a bad use of our time. We have a lot of open time tomorrow too so if we get some, if we're not, if we authentically have open time let's talk about tomorrow. Cool, and Mariah you got that about the appointment. Cool, I think that's all we've got. We will have some if we have more thoughts and if anything else comes to mind Dr. Cole or if you have questions by all means give us a ring. Wonderful, thank you so much. Go ahead and we'll make sure you don't end up in the weird meeting next time. Hey, no problem. Thanks man, you have a good day. All right, bye-bye. you
