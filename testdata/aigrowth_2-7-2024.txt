 Chat GPT has made me smarter. No, I don't actually see myself as some kind of genius, but I will say that since Chat GPT fell within my reach in early 2023, I have pursued an incessant stream of scientific and cultural journeys that have had an immeasurable impact on my life in a variety of ways. First and foremost, it has empowered me to be able to research into things that I never could have dreamed I could. I'm a person who has lots of questions about what goes on in the universe, and I'm always thirsting for answers. And historically, I don't have enough people I can ask the questions to, and I can't digest the answers quickly enough. But now I can literally sit down and ask Chat GPT to explain to me, like I'm a five-year-old, how the theory of relativity works. Which I found out is not just one theory, but is a pair of theories that's special in the general theories of relativity, as theorized by Albert Einstein. This is stuff I didn't know. I didn't think I was capable of understanding it. And I do have a fairly good understanding of what's going on. I had a degree in chemistry, and so I've always had a strength in understanding of things at the extreme microscopic, you know, at the quantum level. I did take quantum, you know, a class that was akin to quantum mechanics, physical chemistry, which is a does cover goes into quantum phenomena, at least for part of the part of the year. You know, that's one semester. But that's not a lot. And I won't claim that I know really anything from that, other than that I understand things like uncertainty and duality and those things. So I've embarked on a, I watched a video on YouTube. Now YouTube is another tool that has really empowered people to learn more quickly. So I was able to go and find some, I watched a video that I didn't intend to watch. A friend of mine brought it to my attention. And it was about the duality of particles, duality of light particles, the photon. And I got all worked up because I just never settled well with the whole concept of the photon for a variety of reasons. Coming from chemistry, there's just a few reasons. It just doesn't seem to jive. And anyway, I've been able to learn a huge amount about photons. In fact, to the point where I now feel empowered to actually embark on a real investigation or some demonstration of what, you know, what might really be, you know, a phenomenon in the universe that I think nobody has explained yet. And that's exciting. Now, whether I'm true or not, I've gotten smart enough, at least somewhat more educated. You know, this is, we're talking eight months now that I've gathered a bunch more knowledge. Now, of course, I pursue the most kooky things that anybody would want to pursue, like trying to pursue a theory of, you know, a theory of relativity that ties together quantum and cosmic phenomena. And I'm getting close to believe, I believe I'm close to having something like that. And I believe it's very simple. Just no more complex than what Einstein proposed and actually does work together to those things and complements them and would complete the picture. It may even be that would complement them. Now, it's a long shot, but I wouldn't have been empowered to even say these words a year ago. I would not have been empowered to say these words a year ago. It allows you to embark on whatever journey you want. Now, there is a limit to that journey. And I, and that is, and I'll go back to some of the stuff we learned. The limit to that journey is, Chad GBT accepts the same things that humans accept. Which means if you're challenging a fundamental of physics, you've got a good party to debunk your story, but you don't have a very good party to try and help you do the math. Because what I've found is as soon as Chad GBT knows that I'm trying to prove something that might not be consistent with science, it starts to spin the data and the results in that fashion. Almost to the point where it will either refuse to do a calculation because it knows the answer already, or it will rub my face in the fact that, you know, this outlines the complex nature, blah, blah, blah. And it is definitely, that's exactly what's happening. I have to hide my intent from it in order to get objectivity often, which is crazy. But regardless, this is what we're dealing with is these nut jobs that are modeled after us. But it's been phenomenal because in science, there's really nothing better than something that's going to debunk your theory. I don't like that it doesn't, that it tries to stifle objective thinking, which it absolutely does. But that is because other humans do, and that's just our pattern. It doesn't know any better. I'll get the same, I'll run into the same thing with other humans. In fact, thank God for Chad GBT because I was able to go this journey without getting somebody's approval. Humans would have done exactly the same thing. Exactly the same thing. So it's fascinating. Coming back to what I've learned, it's allowed me to embark on a study of Egyptian pyramids. And I've learned more about the Old Kingdom pyramids than anybody could ever know. No, that's not true. There's people that know a lot. But I know a lot about it now. And I have a good understanding about, I have a theory, my own theory for why they're there. Are these partial part of the reasoning? I have a couple theories for why they are structured the way they are. And I think these things are obvious if you just open your eyes and look objectively. And I'm as objective as you could get because I knew nothing about these things six months ago. So it's fun. I get to embark on things that I could not have done that are exciting that I might actually be able to contribute to. That's cool. That's cool. That's cool. And there's a ton of that kind of stuff. But that's the two big areas I'm in. The other one I've done a lot is, and I just got fired up looking at the Nile River Valley. And I'm really interested in human evolution and history and archaeology. And so I'm really, I've been heavily immersed in trying to understand what, you know, just try to put my head around what went on in ancient Egypt. I believe I've got a hunch that after the Old Kingdoms, there was a severe drought followed by an extreme flood and then the flood took everybody out. I know that there were some significant changes between Old Kingdom and the newer kingdoms, the fourth or the fifth dynasty and beyond. I know there was a gap between the two significant, not, there was a significant gap in time. It could have been a hundred years, several hundred years maybe between the two dynasties, which means that was a pretty tough time. You know, there was a time when they were eating mummies and shit and the genetics, all from data I was able to look up, the genealogy of the area says that there wasn't a big shift in genetics 4500 years ago, 4800 years ago. But I think there was a shift in culture. A lot of the stone capabilities that they'd had before simply weren't around any longer. The people who knew how to build the original pyramids, you know, the guy that cooked up the, you know, manna and that kind of guy, those guys got killed. Those guys washed away in the flood. I'm nearly positive. Or who knows what, maybe just followed the disarray after that. But it didn't, it didn't go good. I think, I think there was drought, drought, drought, and then fucking mega flood. And that all was left was the people on the fringes, the poor people, the people that were way out in the outskirts. Everybody, if any wealth was living right there in the water, basically in the valley with water. If you were in the outskirts, you were just scraping by, probably dying. So the people that lived maybe were like the middle class. They weren't so far out that they were dead in the desert, but they weren't so close up that they were getting some water. So they were about to die. And then the big wave came and killed all the fucking wealthy. I mean, all of them. All of them. All of them. All of them. Everybody that had an education. Everybody that knew how to make up a stone pot. Because there were these awesome stone vases that they made, first through fourth dynasty, that did not any longer, they didn't have the technology to do it again. The pyramids themselves represent something that we technologically could no longer achieve after that period. They went somewhere and they went somewhere that lost all their records. And I would suggest that two things, two really great things. One, all their records are out there in the fucking delta somewhere. And to the extent that they were written on paper or papyrus, which I bet tons and tons and tons of stuff was. I mean, stone was not their main. They wrote in stone when it needed to be permanent. That didn't represent much. The rest of the time they were writing on, you know, ink on a piece of paper, a piece of papyrus. And that's where your contract was in, you know, the typical contract. That's just long fucking, you know, that's just long gone. They're cutting the stuff written in stone around, but those are going to be weird things, things that they intended to stick around a long time. But all that stuff, it's a non-anerobic environment. Nothing ever changes. That stuff that the delta doesn't change. It just piles more and more silt on top. Every single document is down there somewhere under the silt. Every single one. Every single one of them. Along with every single person that washed away, probably nearly fully intact. With clothing and all. All the way down to fucking Mena. Who knows who? Everybody washed the hell away. That's why there's no history about everybody and all the paperwork and everything washed away. They had lots of paper records. They just didn't make it. They intended to keep them, but they didn't make it. They were probably stuffed, you know, some portion of them were stuffed to the top of that thing. They probably went in there and fucking ransacked it and threw it all out. Fuck, who left this shit? Bunch of fucking cranky ass crap. I don't know who they did, but that's a huge sidetrack. Knowledge. TadGBT has allowed me to become this nut that I am today. I'm very excited about that. The knowledge piece is something I've been excited for forever. And now I can ask, without judgment, I can ask about facts. How does that work? What's that about? What are they doing there? How come this happened? Why did they do this? What happened in history here? Why would you do it this way? Oh my god, it's great. And it isn't a super genius in and of itself, but it has a formidable intellect. And within reach, a lot of factual information. A lot of good factual information. Hey, hey. I'm back in black with my nut sack. In the crack. In my mom's house. Back in black, black in back, in the crack. In my nut sack. In my sack. You ready to go? In that pocket. All right, we gotta go tonight or I'm not gonna be able to do anything. Ready to private. Okay.
